## Japan 1 km estimated climate values

The Japan-only temperature (daily mean, maximum and minimum), precipitation, and all-sky solar irradiance values are derived from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) 1991–2020 station daily normals and existing independently estimated monthly 1 km meshes. Japan relative humidity is independently estimated on the same grid from 1991–2020 station daily mean humidity observations and official station monthly normals. They are **not** official JMA daily 1 km normals or observations at every mesh. The public tiles contain only derived mesh values; they do not include station records or source archives. Solar estimates have particularly sparse supporting observations. Humidity values are unavailable in cells too far from the supporting stations; missing cells are not filled with NASA values.

The 1 km descriptor is the output grid spacing, not a claim of 1 km observational accuracy. This product is not endorsed by JMA.

## NASA POWER

Outside Japan, climate values are retrieved at runtime from the NASA Langley Research Center POWER Project Climatology and Daily APIs. The site requests temperature, corrected precipitation, all-sky surface shortwave downward irradiance, relative humidity, daily maximum temperature, and daily minimum temperature for January 1991 through December 2020. Daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily all-sky surface shortwave downward irradiance, and daily mean relative humidity are averaged by calendar day in the browser. Japan selections use the derived 1 km values above for all displayed fields and do not request NASA POWER data.

The global annual and monthly map layers are derived from the public POWER Data v10 monthly Zarr datasets in the NASA POWER AWS Open Data store. Meteorological layers use the MERRA-2 monthly LST source grid. Solar layers combine SRB for 1991–2000 and SYN1deg for 2001–2020, following the source periods used by POWER for the selected 1991–2020 climatology. Source-grid values are aggregated to monthly climatologies and day-weighted annual values, colorized, and reprojected to Web Mercator without smoothing between source cells.

## Natural Earth

The world boundary layer and country names are derived from Natural Earth 1:50m Admin 0 Countries. Capital names and the nearby-place index are derived from Natural Earth 1:10m Populated Places Simple version 5.1.2. The nearby-place index retains places with `SCALERANK <= 5`, admin-0 capitals, or admin-1 capitals. Natural Earth data is in the public domain.

## Plant catalog and native-region guide

The names, accepted taxonomic concepts and native botanical-region lists in `data/plants.json` are adapted from Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Plants of the World Online / Kew Names and Taxonomic Backbone / Kew Backbone Distributions (World Checklist of Vascular Plants), checked 2026-09-26. Each plant includes a direct source link. Introduced regions are excluded. Species, natural varieties, subspecies and cultigens are labelled separately. Dracaena trifasciata is the snake-plant species, not the entire former Sansevieria genus. Common genus names are represented by an explicitly named species. Birkin is retained as a requested horticultural name with unresolved species origin and no native outline.

### WGSRPD geographic regions

The display-only outlines join the listed botanical regions from the TDWG World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (WGSRPD), Level 3. They are **not** observed or modelled wild-range or habitat boundaries and do not imply presence throughout an enclosed region. Contiguous regions share an outside outline; disconnected regions/islands have separate outlines. Interior holes are omitted. The outer rings are simplified by 0.025 degrees for drawing. No occurrence observations or habitat polygons are distributed.

### Reference ratings and horticultural names

Stars are our **provisional editorial screening** of how readily native climate can inform cultivation, not hardiness ratings, growing suitability scores, evidence confidence scores, or official ratings from the cited institutions. Reasons and source links accompany every entry. The default rating uses distribution breadth, cultigen status and horticultural category; where species/cultivar comparisons are unassessed, that limitation is stated. Individual ratings draw on the linked cultivation guidance or original studies. No universal equality between wild and cultivar temperature tolerance is claimed.

- Annual and perennial flower cultivation guidance: North Carolina Extension Gardener Plant Toolbox, each species page linked in its entry, <https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/>; Clarkia: <https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/84578/clarkia-amoena/details>; herbaceous peonies: <https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/peony/herbaceous/growing-guide>
- Flowering tree cultivation guidance: the same NC State species pages, including cultivar changes to cold tolerance, heat tolerance, chilling requirements and reblooming; Enkianthus: <https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/6395/enkianthus-perulatus/details>. Winter survival and frost damage to spring flowers are distinguished in our descriptions.
- Australian plant guidance: Australian Native Plants Society (Australia), <https://anpsa.org.au/plant_profiles/>; Australian National Botanic Gardens profiles for Boronia heterophylla and Leucophyta brownii; RHS species profiles for Eucalyptus gunnii and Westringia fruticosa. Leptospermum petersonii habitat is from the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney's PlantNET. Every individual reference has a direct link in the catalog. Grafted Eremophila, hybrid cultivars and provenance differences are explicitly distinguished from the wild species.
- Succulent guidance: NC State and RHS species profiles, plus SANBI PlantZAfrica, <https://pza.sanbi.org/>. The Haworthia cooperi example is specifically var. picturata; H. cymbiformis and H. truncata guidance is specifically the nominal variety. Their outline still represents the species-level botanical regions. Aeonium arboreum is the wild green-leaved species, with black-leaved garden cultivars distinguished in the note; RHS Aeonium trial results supply that horticultural comparison. These are short factual paraphrases, with no source photos or full profiles redistributed.
- Caudex references: Kew species and subspecies distributions, SANBI PlantZAfrica species profiles and its 2023 succulent identification guide, and NC State profiles for Adenium obesum and Jatropha podagrica. Pachypodium rosulatum subsp. gracilius is distinguished from the parent species and hybrids. Tylecodon reticulatus uses explicitly identified genus-level seasonal guidance. Notes distinguish rooted, established plants on their own roots from unrooted or grafted stock, and exposed tubers from their native underground environment. Direct links accompany the individual factual paraphrases; no source photos or full profiles are redistributed.
- Vegetable cultivation guidance and original studies: direct links in each entry's `reference.sourceUrl`. These supply short factual paraphrases; no source photos, full articles, figures or plant-profile text are redistributed.
- Tagetes patula is treated as a synonym of T. erecta by Kew and as a separate horticultural profile by NC State: <https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/252146-1>, <https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/tagetes-patula/>. Both common names resolve to one catalog entry; the note distinguishes their garden groups.

## Köppen–Geiger climate classification

The optional climate-classification overlay is derived from the 1991–2020, 0.1-degree map in Beck et al. (2023). The distributed raster is reprojected to Web Mercator with nearest-neighbour sampling and retains the source class colors. The Figshare dataset is distributed under CC0 1.0.
